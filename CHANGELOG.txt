Deprecated CHANGELOG file as functionnality is provided by GitHub
website from now on.

#####
Version 1.0.0-M2 (2009-02-10) - Codename A new dawn

- Added ASF license file.
- Added javadoc.
- Refactored SMTPServer class to use a configuration object 
  making internals less tied and much cleaner.
- Javadoced each configuration option to make clear when their 
  value is read.
- The charset and the data deferred size new values will now be 
  reread at each server startup.
- Removed the getHelp(..) method from the Command interface.
- Command objects now have a direct reference to their
  CommandHandler.
- Reworked starp/stop methods and added a shutdown method to the 
  SMTPServer class thus allowing to restart multiple times the same 
  instance until shutdown is called.
- Removed the acceptor thread pool which is not used since the 
  migration to MINA 2.
- New empty constructor in SMTPServer class for ease of use.
- Added mail trace in the default implementation of the 
  DeliveryHandler.
- Improved by 10% large data transfers by preventing unnecessary
  IoBuffer copies due to auto expanding.
- Improved DefaultDeliveryHandler against concurrent modifications
  of it's deliveries list.
- Fixed internal state after the end of a data transfer. This is no
  more the DeliveryHandler job to reset it's state at the end of the
  data(...) method because it's resetMessageState() method will be 
  called.
- Extracted Delivery and SharedStreamUtils classes from the
  AbstractDeliveryHandler class to further prevent custom implementations
  from duplicating existing code.
- Added NPE check to the authentication API to prevent a custom factory
  from returning a null instance.
   
#####
Version 1.0.0-M1 (2009-01-19) - Codename The 5th of November

- Migrated to MINA 2.0.0-M4 (was previously using a 1.1.x version)
- Big code refactoring to make code easy to understand.
- Added junit tests for the new funtionnalities.
- Removed some unnecessary classes and interfaces that
  only add complexity to the code.
- API cleaning by renaming classes to reflect their real use.
- The MessageListener list can now be modified on the fly and
  changes are immediately available to new connections.
- The new MessageDelivery API allows to control how
  mail messages are delivered without having to 'reinvent the wheel' 
  each time building on the available and tested code from the 
  AbstractDeliveryHandler class.
- Fixed HelpCommand class : prettified help messages, handled
  DATA_END correctly.
- Removed some unnecessary resets of the session state.
- Resolved a potential concurrency problem in WiserMessage.getData()
  method and marked it as deprecated as it is a very bad design idea.
- Added a SessionContext to the MessageListener API :
  it provides the ability to store some private attributes between 
  the execution of the accept and deliver methods while also providing
  the remote ip and the credential as parameters for these methods.
- Fixed EHLO announce of supported AUTH mechanisms.
- Fixed error code returned when a TooMuchDataException occurs.
- Removed the fake VRFY command which is not part of the default required
  command set of a SMTP implementation.
- Added some adapter classes to reduce code writing on simple applications.
- Fixed AuthenticationHandler and LoginValidator interface which raised an 
  incorrect exception.
- Fixed a rare threading issue allowing a re authentication immediately
  after a successfull authentication.
- Fixed bad commands handling and error codes messages.
